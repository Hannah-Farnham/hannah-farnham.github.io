								Overview
							</h2>
							<p>
								I noticed my parents letting food from their CSA share go to waste. Unfamiliar vegetables would often end up in the compost. I wanted to create an app that helps people solve that issue. How can we cook with unfamiliar produce? And, how do we discover what is growing locally in our viciinity? 
								<br>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="snippet">
							<h2>
								Solution
							</h2>
							<p>
								For this project, we went through a regimented process to create a product, from problem discovery to high-fidelity prototypes. We interviewed, sketched, tested, and designed apps around the topic of our choosing. I found a way to create an app that allows people to discover local food vendors, educate themselves on the produce, and how they can use it.

							<h3>
								Scan & Identify Produce
							</h3>
							<p>
								When users encounter produce that they don't recognize, they can take a picture to identify it. This takes them to an overview of that fruit or vegetable. This overview includes <em>flavor notes, seasonality, region, storage tips, health benefits, and recipe suggestions.</em>
							</p>
							<br>
							<h4>
								Use Case: A mother and young son are at the farmer's market. She wants to educate him and create curiousity around food and where it comes from. He finds a watermelon radish, they snap a photo, and they learn where it was grown, and how they can cook with it together.
							</h4>
						</div>

					<div class="feature-block">
						<div class="phone-text">
							<h3>
								Discover Recipes by Ingredient
							</h3>
							<p>
								Users can manually input produce to find recipes based on that ingredient. The app contains recipes with reviews and cook times from different sources on the web.

							<h4>
								Use Case: If someone is at the grocery store, they can make more informed decisions about which produce to purchase. It is likely that seasonal produce will not have traveled a smaller distance, and have more nutritional value, than produce that is out of season in the area.

							<h4>
								Flow 1

							<h3>
								Take Stock
							</h3>
							<p>
								During the testing phase, I conducted usability sessions with five participants to observe how they interacted with and navigated the app. One of the initial features allowed users to catalog the contents of their fridge, inspired by frequent mentions of food waste during early interviews. However, through testing and reflection, I realized this feature strayed from the app’s core purpose—helping users discover local produce and learn how to use it. In response, I replaced it with a feature that lets users take a photo of local produce to identify it and explore ways to cook with it.

					<div class="feature-block">
						<div>
							<h4>
							Flow 2

							<h3>
								Recipe Swipe
							</h3>
							<p>
								This was another feature that evolved significantly during testing. Originally, users could swipe through different recipes—an interaction that, while engaging, began to drift from the app’s main focus. To maintain clarity and purpose, I removed this feature and instead introduced a way for users to discover recipes by ingredient. The swiping concept could be revisited in a future phase of the project as an enhancement once the core experience is more established.

							<h3>
								Build Your Grocery List
							</h3>
							<p>
								Based on the recipe a user selected, the necessary ingredients would automatically populate their grocery list. From there, I wanted to extend the experience by helping users find nearby grocery stores that carried those items. Each store would include a “local food rating,” indicating how much of their produce was locally sourced—encouraging users to make more informed and sustainable shopping choices.
