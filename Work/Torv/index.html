								Overview
							</h2>
							<p>
								<em>The goal was to evoke a sense of community</em> through a digital forum. I drew inspiration from the idea of a gathering place, similar to an old village square or community house. The problem arose from the observation that <em>people struggle to meet others within their community</em> or to get involved locally. I wanted to create a digital space for people to discover what was happening around them, and get involved. I explored how we can create a sense of community in a city environment, where our repeated interaction with others is limited.

							<h2>
								Solution
							</h2>
							<p>
								For this project, we went through a regimented process to create a product, from problem discovery to high-fidelity prototypes. We interviewed, sketched, tested, and designed apps around the topic of our choosing. My main issue was grappling with the concept of how to create lasting connections with other people. I solved this through attempting <em>to showcase local happenings, giving people the option to attend, meet, and connect</em> in person and on the app.

								Flow 1
							</h4>
							<h3>
								Sign Up
							</h3>
							<p>
								I began by designing the sign-up flow, since onboarding was the primary objective of this project. Starting here also allowed me to uncover additional features the app needed to support a meaningful user experience. I incorporated insights from my user interviews directly into this flow — those conversations revealed valuable perspectives on what people look for in social and event-based apps, from connection-driven design to seamless discovery.

							<h4>
							Flow 2

							<h3>
								Discover Events
							</h3>
							<p>
								At this stage, I began building out the event cards, event landing page, filtering system, and map view. My goal was to make it easy for users to explore events happening right in their local area. This section became the core discovery experience — where people could browse nearby happenings and see which of their neighbors were attending.

							<h3>
								Chat
							</h3>
							<p>
								Users can access the chat feature directly from the event pages. Once on an event page, they can join a group chat with other attendees to connect before or after the event. The avatars within the chat are interactive, allowing users to engage with one another in a more dynamic and playful way.

							<h3>
								Sign Up
							</h3>
							<p>
								During the testing phase, I conducted usability sessions with five participants to observe how they navigated the app. The Sign-Up Flow generated the most feedback — users suggested simplifying certain steps, creating a clearer introduction, and adjusting the visual hierarchy to highlight what felt most important. These insights helped me refine the flow to feel more intuitive and engaging.

							<h3>
								Discover Events
							</h3>

								Feedback on the event discovery flow mainly centered around helping users understand how to navigate this feature. My goal was to keep the experience intuitive while still offering something new and engaging. I revisited my research findings to refine the filtering system — ensuring it aligned with how people naturally build and sustain meaningful relationships.

							<h3>
								Chat + Profile
							</h3>
							<p>
								This feature became a lower priority toward the end of the project due to the number of other components in development. My goal here was to highlight how users could join chats, interact with others, and express their personalities through their profiles. I wanted to strike a balance — allowing people to share just enough to feel authentic and connected, without requiring too much personal information, while still ensuring a sense of safety within the community.
