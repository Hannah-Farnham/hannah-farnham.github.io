								Overview

							<p>
								The assignment was to create a book using the methods and practices we learned in the course. We could pick any subject matter to create the book. It was supposed to be an already existing text, but I came up with a different concept.

							<h2>
								Concept
							</h2>
							<p>
								I came up with the idea to create a book touching on biking culture in New York cs. Copenhagen. I began biking when I lived in Copenhagen, and now I bike in New York. You can imagine there are several differences. I wanted to capture some of the feeling of biking in each city. So I set out to research, document, and interview people for both cities.

								I looked to reddit to fill in gaps for how people thought about the bike lane in each city. People commented on safety, advice, frustrations, etc. I also looked to bike shops in Copenhagen to learn about the different bike available, and about the craftmanship involved in the actual bikes themselves.

								Collecting Images
							</h3>
							<p>
								For a couple weeks, I walked around New York next to the bike lane. I snapped pictures as people rode by on my phone and on a film camera. In Denmark, I asked my mentor, Jeanette, to take pictures of bikes and bikers. And she delivered. I wanted to have these observations of who was in the bike lane, and how people were using the bike lane.

							<h3>
								Scan Unfamiliar Produce
							</h3>
							<p>
								I began by designing the sign-up flow, since onboarding was the primary objective of this project. Starting here also allowed me to uncover additional features the app needed to support a meaningful user experience. I incorporated insights from my user interviews directly into this flow — those conversations revealed valuable perspectives on what people look for in social and event-based apps, from connection-driven design to seamless discovery.

							<h4>
							Flow 2

							<h3>
								Build Lists Through Recipes
							</h3>
							<p>
								At this stage, I began building out the event cards, event landing page, filtering system, and map view. My goal was to make it easy for users to explore events happening right in their local area. This section became the core discovery experience — where people could browse nearby happenings and see which of their neighbors were attending.

							<h3>
								Find Recipes Based on What's In Season

							<p>
								Users can access the chat feature directly from the event pages. Once on an event page, they can join a group chat with other attendees to connect before or after the event. The avatars within the chat are interactive, allowing users to engage with one another in a more dynamic and playful way.
