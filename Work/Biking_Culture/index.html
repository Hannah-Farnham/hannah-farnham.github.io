								Overview

							<p>
								The assignment was to create a book using the methods and practices we learned in the course. We could pick any subject matter to create the book. It was supposed to be an already existing text, but I came up with a different concept.

						<div class="snippet">
							<h2>
								Concept
							</h2>
							<p>
								I came up with the idea to create a book touching on biking culture in New York cs. Copenhagen. I began biking when I lived in Copenhagen, and now I bike in New York. You can imagine there are several differences. I wanted to capture some of the feeling of biking in each city. So I set out to research, document, and interview people for both cities.

							<h3>
								Collecting Vibes 
							</h3>
							<p>
								To fill in gaps in my research, I turned to Reddit to understand how people in each city think about biking. Discussions covered everything from safety and advice to daily frustrations and cultural nuances. I also explored local bike shops in Copenhagen to learn more about the types of bikes available and the craftsmanship that goes into building them.

								Collecting Images
							</h3>
							<p>
								For a few weeks, I observed the bike lanes in New York—walking alongside them and snapping photos of cyclists on both my phone and film camera. In Denmark, I asked my mentor, Jeanette, to capture similar images of bikes and riders—and she delivered beautifully. These observations helped me document who occupied the bike lanes in each city and how people interacted with them in their daily routines.

						Interviews

					<p id="large-size-body">
						<br>
						I did hour long interviews with two people from Copenhagen and two people from New York about their experience with biking in each city. These were really fun and informative, and I learned about the difference in culture, and how that effects what we experience in the bike lane.
