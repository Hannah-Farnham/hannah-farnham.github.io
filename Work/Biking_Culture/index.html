								Overview

							<p>
								The assignment was to create a book using the methods and practices we learned in the course. We could pick any subject matter to create the book. It was supposed to be an already existing text, but I came up with a different concept.

							<h2>
								Concept
							</h2>
							<p>
								I came up with the idea to create a book touching on biking culture in New York cs. Copenhagen. I began biking when I lived in Copenhagen, and now I bike in New York. You can imagine there are several differences. I wanted to capture some of the feeling of biking in each city. So I set out to research, document, and interview people for both cities.

								During the testing phase, I conducted usability sessions with five participants to observe how they navigated the app. The Sign-Up Flow generated the most feedback — users suggested simplifying certain steps, creating a clearer introduction, and adjusting the visual hierarchy to highlight what felt most important. These insights helped me refine the flow to feel more intuitive and engaging.

I revisited my research findings to refine the filtering system — ensuring it aligned with how people naturally build and sustain meaningful relationships.

							<p>
								This feature became a lower priority toward the end of the project due to the number of other components in development. My goal here was to highlight how users could join chats, interact with others, and express their personalities through their profiles. I wanted to strike a balance — allowing people to share just enough to feel authentic and connected, without requiring too much personal information, while still ensuring a sense of safety within the community.

								Flow 1

							<h3>
								Scan Unfamiliar Produce
							</h3>
							<p>
								I began by designing the sign-up flow, since onboarding was the primary objective of this project. Starting here also allowed me to uncover additional features the app needed to support a meaningful user experience. I incorporated insights from my user interviews directly into this flow — those conversations revealed valuable perspectives on what people look for in social and event-based apps, from connection-driven design to seamless discovery.

							<h4>
							Flow 2
							</h4>
							<h3>
								Build Lists Through Recipes
							</h3>
							<p>
								At this stage, I began building out the event cards, event landing page, filtering system, and map view. My goal was to make it easy for users to explore events happening right in their local area. This section became the core discovery experience — where people could browse nearby happenings and see which of their neighbors were attending.

							<h3>
								Find Recipes Based on What's In Season

							<p>
								Users can access the chat feature directly from the event pages. Once on an event page, they can join a group chat with other attendees to connect before or after the event. The avatars within the chat are interactive, allowing users to engage with one another in a more dynamic and playful way.
