								Play as Research: Parsons x KADK Collaboration
								This interdisciplinary course explored play as both a creative research method and a social experience. In collaboration with graduate students from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (KADK), we examined how play can reveal and reshape communal dynamics in everyday life. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Guided by Jesper Juul, Nancy Nowacek, and John Sharp, the course combined approaches from social practice art, participatory and systems design, and iterative experimentation. Beginning with a hands-on workshop at Parsons and culminating in a collaborative week-long residency in Copenhagen, the class emphasized play as a tool for inquiry, interaction, and collective making.

								Choose Your Path
							</h2>
							<p>
								I collaborated with a team of five students from Parsons and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (KADK) to design a game that reimagined wayfinding at the Design Museum Denmark. Our goal was to make navigation more intuitive and engaging through play. 
								<br>
								<br>
								We developed a system of themed pathways that encouraged visitors to explore the museum in different ways — including a Danish design–focused route, a comprehensive route covering every exhibit, and a playful, curiosity-driven path. Along each route, visitors could collect tokens featuring interactive prompts and contextual facts, turning the act of moving through the museum into a participatory and exploratory experience.

								Problem
							</h2>
							<p>
								We began the week with a visit to the Danish Design Museum, where we met with guide manager, Malene to learn about the museum’s existing challenges with visitor flow. She highlighted key problem areas — particularly where guests tended to get lost or disengaged. Notably, the museum’s layout opened with an exhibition of Japanese prints, which often caused confusion among visitors expecting to encounter Danish design artifacts first. Using these insights, we kicked off our ideation process the following day to explore ways of improving clarity and engagement through play.

								Research Questions

							<ul>
								<li>
									How might we have the guest move through the museums without worrying about wayfinding?

								<li>
									How might we encourage play in a museum setting?
								</li>
								<li>
									How can play serve a method or outcome to create new forms of learning and engagement?

									How might we nudge visitors to more fully experience DMD?

							<h3>
								Scan Unfamiliar Produce
							</h3>
							<p>
								I began by designing the sign-up flow, since onboarding was the primary objective of this project. Starting here also allowed me to uncover additional features the app needed to support a meaningful user experience. I incorporated insights from my user interviews directly into this flow — those conversations revealed valuable perspectives on what people look for in social and event-based apps, from connection-driven design to seamless discovery.

							<h4>
							Flow 2
							</h4>
							<h3>
								Build Lists Through Recipes
							</h3>
							<p>
								At this stage, I began building out the event cards, event landing page, filtering system, and map view. My goal was to make it easy for users to explore events happening right in their local area. This section became the core discovery experience — where people could browse nearby happenings and see which of their neighbors were attending.

							<p>
								Users can access the chat feature directly from the event pages. Once on an event page, they can join a group chat with other attendees to connect before or after the event. The avatars within the chat are interactive, allowing users to engage with one another in a more dynamic and playful way.

							<h3>
								Sign Up
							</h3>
							<p>
								During the testing phase, I conducted usability sessions with five participants to observe how they navigated the app. The Sign-Up Flow generated the most feedback — users suggested simplifying certain steps, creating a clearer introduction, and adjusting the visual hierarchy to highlight what felt most important. These insights helped me refine the flow to feel more intuitive and engaging.

							<h3>
								Discover Events
							</h3>

								Feedback on the event discovery flow mainly centered around helping users understand how to navigate this feature. My goal was to keep the experience intuitive while still offering something new and engaging. I revisited my research findings to refine the filtering system — ensuring it aligned with how people naturally build and sustain meaningful relationships.

							<h3>
								Chat + Profile
							</h3>
							<p>
								This feature became a lower priority toward the end of the project due to the number of other components in development. My goal here was to highlight how users could join chats, interact with others, and express their personalities through their profiles. I wanted to strike a balance — allowing people to share just enough to feel authentic and connected, without requiring too much personal information, while still ensuring a sense of safety within the community.
