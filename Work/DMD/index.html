								Overview
							</h2>
							<p>
								I noticed my parents letting food from their CSA share go to waste. Unfamiliar vegetables would often end up in the compost. I wanted to create an app that helps people solve that issue. How can we cook with unfamiliar produce? And, how do we discover what is growing locally in our viciinity? 
								<br>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="snippet">
							<h2>
								Solution
							</h2>
							<p>
								For this project, we went through a regimented process to create a product, from problem discovery to high-fidelity prototypes. We interviewed, sketched, tested, and designed apps around the topic of our choosing. I found a way to create an app that allows people to discover local food vendors, educate themselves on the produce, and how they can use it.

							<h3>
								Scan Unfamiliar Produce
							</h3>
							<p>
								I began by designing the sign-up flow, since onboarding was the primary objective of this project. Starting here also allowed me to uncover additional features the app needed to support a meaningful user experience. I incorporated insights from my user interviews directly into this flow — those conversations revealed valuable perspectives on what people look for in social and event-based apps, from connection-driven design to seamless discovery.

							<h4>
							Flow 2
							</h4>
							<h3>
								Build Lists Through Recipes
							</h3>
							<p>
								At this stage, I began building out the event cards, event landing page, filtering system, and map view. My goal was to make it easy for users to explore events happening right in their local area. This section became the core discovery experience — where people could browse nearby happenings and see which of their neighbors were attending.

								Users can access the chat feature directly from the event pages. Once on an event page, they can join a group chat with other attendees to connect before or after the event. The avatars within the chat are interactive, allowing users to engage with one another in a more dynamic and playful way.

							<h3>
								Sign Up
							</h3>
							<p>
								During the testing phase, I conducted usability sessions with five participants to observe how they navigated the app. The Sign-Up Flow generated the most feedback — users suggested simplifying certain steps, creating a clearer introduction, and adjusting the visual hierarchy to highlight what felt most important. These insights helped me refine the flow to feel more intuitive and engaging.

					<div class="feature-block">

							<h4>
							Flow 2

							<h3>
								Discover Events
							</h3>
							<p>
								Feedback on the event discovery flow mainly centered around helping users understand how to navigate this feature. My goal was to keep the experience intuitive while still offering something new and engaging. I revisited my research findings to refine the filtering system — ensuring it aligned with how people naturally build and sustain meaningful relationships.

							<h3>
								Chat + Profile
							</h3>
							<p>
								This feature became a lower priority toward the end of the project due to the number of other components in development. My goal here was to highlight how users could join chats, interact with others, and express their personalities through their profiles. I wanted to strike a balance — allowing people to share just enough to feel authentic and connected, without requiring too much personal information, while still ensuring a sense of safety within the community.
